title: “Down Under” Tax Strikes Again
---
You may recall from a previous post I talked about the [Down Under Tax]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2011-05-11-samsung-series-9-laptops-and-the-down-under-tax.md % }) that Harvey Norman had applied to the Samsung Series 9 laptops, well today Lenovo has had to <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/lenovo-defends-aussie-thinkpad-pricing-339315254.htm" target="_blank">defend its aussie pricing</a> of its new X1 laptop.

Over the weekend Harvey Norman had a 30% sale on all laptops, so it just goes to show the kind of mark-up they have on these to be able to simply chop nearly a third off the price tag. This brought the laptop within my budget, plus I’m heading overseas next week so I’ll be able to get the GST back. All up this brings the price down to $1570 – a much more reasonable price I think.
