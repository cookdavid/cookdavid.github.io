title: Moving from Exchange Server to Google Mail for Windows Phone 7
---
As part of my organisations move from Exchange Server to Google Mail I needed to update my phone settings to sync to the Google server. To do this, from the home screen I select the right arrow at the top of the screen:


![winphone]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/winphone1.png){:height="209px" width="222px"}

Then selected **Settings**:


![winphonesettings]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/winphonesettings.png){:height="71px" width="240px"}

Finally, select **email &amp; accounts** –&gt; **Outlook**.

My existing settings have the username as my network login&#160; id, and the server set to exchange.mycompanydomain. To switch over to using the Google Mail server, I changed the username to my email address (e.g. <a href="mailto:david_cook@mycompanydomain">david_cook@mycompanydomain</a>) and changed the server to **m.google.com**. After saving I received an alert *Action Required* on the email &amp; accounts screen. Selecting the Outlook account I was prompted to “Update your password for m.google.com and press Save" after re-entering my password the account showed *Synchronising* and my emails are now syncing via Google Mail.
