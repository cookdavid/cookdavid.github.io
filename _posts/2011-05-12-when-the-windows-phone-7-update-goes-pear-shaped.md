Yesterday I advised that the [NoDo update has been released by Telstra]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2011-05-10-telcos-holding-us-to-ransom.md %}), unfortunately the update process didn't go so smoothly. At the second last step it was supposed to do a reboot, but unfortunately the phone vibrated 7 times then hung on the boot screen. I left the phone and Zune update process for a considerable amount of time, but it was obvious the upgrade had failed. Attempts to reboot the phone by switching it off and on all simply returned to the same state. Further attempts to get it working including a factory reset also failed. Unfortunately the process of performing a factory reset effectively wipes everything off the phone and takes you back to the raw ROM, but seeing as the ROM is in a partial state - this is not possible. After much research on the web trying to find a solution I came across the following blog: <a href="http://barrymoves.blogspot.com/2011/05/did-you-use-chevronwp7updater-on-your.html">http://barrymoves.blogspot.com/2011/05/did-you-use-chevronwp7updater-on-your.html</a> which provides instructions for downloading and reloading the original Telstra ROM. So thankfully I now have a nice clean phone at its original state when I first bought it, all I need to do now is re-install all the apps and reconfigure all the settings again.
