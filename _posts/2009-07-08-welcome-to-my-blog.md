title: Welcome to my Blog
---
I’ve been debating the concept of starting my own blog for some time now but have been resisting due to a number of factors:
- In my current position, most of my development is done using an internally developed framework and with internally developed tools. I figured this information would not be relevant to anyone outside of my company.
- I didn’t think that I would have the discipline to keep a blog up to date and that it would become stale very quickly.

Reading articles from many experts in the field such as <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/you-should-write-blogs" target="_blank">Steve Yegge</a>, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SocialNetworkingForDevelopersConferenceTalkVideo.aspx" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000983.html" target="_blank">Jeff Atwood</a>, their advice was very resounding - “why don’t you blog?”. Seeing how easy it was and not costing me anything I decided to create a blog and see what happens.

Much of the work that I do on a daily basis has been done before, I am certainly not breaking any new ground in developing enterprise applications with the .NET platform, so I don’t expect the information here to be original. I am more looking for a way to keep a permanent record of things I am working on, research on particular technologies or design patterns, configurations for applications, ways in which I have found to be more productive etc and if this in any way can be useful for someone else then all the better.

By making my ideas publicly available, my goal is to improve as a developer as well as improve my ability to teach and mentor others.

Thanks for dropping by and please feel free to leave comments, either as constructive criticism about my writing ability or simply to start a discussion about a particular topic.
