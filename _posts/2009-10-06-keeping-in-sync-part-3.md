As a follow up to my previous posts about keeping in Sync, I wanted to show that I now have a forth computer in the mix that I need to keep in sync. I am now the proud owner of a <a href="http://h71016.www7.hp.com/html/interactive/mini2140/model.html" target="_blank">HP Mini 2140</a> running Windows 7 and Office 2010 CTP.

Adding this computer to the mix was a snap, I simply downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.mesh.com/" target="_blank">Live Mesh</a> and added it to my devices. I was then able to sync my working documents and favourites.

For blogging, I am using <a href="http://download.live.com/" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> and as such I am now also syncing my draft posts using <a href="http://www.mesh.com/" target="_blank">Live Mesh</a> between each of my machines. The Live Writer drafts folder is stored under the “My Documents” folder inside “My Weblog Posts\Drafts”. For Windows XP, this equates to C:\Documents and Settings\{Username}\My Documents\My Weblog Posts\Drafts. For Windows 7 it will be under C:\Users\{Username}\My Documents\My Weblog Posts\Drafts. By adding the drafts folder to the Live Mesh Folders and I can work on a post from work, click “Save Draft” then when I get home I can continue where I left off.
