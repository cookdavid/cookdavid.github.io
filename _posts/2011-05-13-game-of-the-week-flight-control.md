title: Game of the Week - Flight Control

![FlightControl]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/flightcontrol.png){:style="display:inline;float:left;margin:0 10px 10px;" :height="260px" width="180px"} As I mentioned in last weeks game [Wordament]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2011-04-30-windows-phone-7-gamewordament.md %}), the keys to a successful portable game are firstly, the game need to be easy to learn but takes a while to master and secondly, you can play for as little as a couple of minutes or a couple of hours. Flight Control is one of those games that will keep you playing all day and not want to put it down.

The game is quite simple, aircraft enter from the edges of the screen and its your job to direct them to their runway to land. The only real rules are that different aircraft types have specific runways that they need to land on, and don't let them crash. Simple enough hey, but as I said earlier, it will keep you coming back for more as you try to squeeze dozens of aircraft on the screen at the same time and keep them from crashing into each other.

Flight Control was originally developed for the iPod touch by Australian game maker <a href="http://firemint.com/" target="_blank">Firemint</a> and has remained in the top all time games for several years now. Flight Control is one of those success stories which has racked up over 4 million downloads and has since been ported to the iPad, Android, Windows Phone 7, Nintendo DS, Playstation and also the PC and Mac. Recently Firemint was <a href="http://www.ausgamers.com/news/read/3054706" target="_blank">acquired by EA Games</a> which will hopefully mean some more capital investment to allow them to keep coming out with more great apps like this.
