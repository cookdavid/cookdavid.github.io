I was listening to the <a href="http://noisetosignal.com.au/franklyspeaking/" target="_blank">Frankly Speaking Podcast</a> the other day and was put onto a great new game for the Windows Phone 7 called <a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=c62201b4-e059-e011-854c-00237de2db9e" target="_blank">Wordament</a>. It's essentially a word search game, but played in real time against other players on the internet. The board consists of 16 tiles and you have 2 minutes to try to find as many words as possible by dragging your finger from one letter to the next. At the end of the 2 minutes you get to see the words you missed, then get shown a leader board to see how you went against your online competitors. I've never been big on word games like boggle or scrabble, but the fast pace and the multi player aspect of the game gets you totally hooked in very little time.

One of the best recipes for phone games is they are easy to play, but take a long time to master, plus, you can play for as little as a few minutes or can play all day and this game certainly fits that bill nicely. You'll go to bed and think, I'll just have one quick game, and before you know it you've been sitting there playing for an hour. I’m totally addicted, not to mention the other great thing is that the game is free. Definitely give it a try.
